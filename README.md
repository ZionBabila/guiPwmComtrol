# PWM Control GUI for Light Experiences

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) for controlling PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to create dynamic light experiences. The application is designed to help artists, designers, and engineers easily manipulate light intensity over time, enabling the creation of intricate lighting patterns and effects. Whether you are working on an interactive installation, theatrical lighting, or a simple mood lighting setup, this tool offers precise control over your light sources.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: The GUI is designed to be accessible to users of all skill levels, with clear controls and visual feedback.
- **Multiple Channel Control**: Simultaneously control multiple PWM channels, allowing for complex light setups with varied timing and intensity.
- **Time-based Control**: Define time intervals for each PWM channel, making it easy to create sequences of lighting effects that change over time.
- **Save and Load Presets**: Save your configurations and easily reload them, making it simple to experiment with different lighting setups.
- **Real-time Preview**: Visualize your lighting effects in real-time, providing immediate feedback and allowing for quick adjustments.

## Installation

For development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ZionBabila/guiPwmComtrol/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage

1. **Select Channels**: Choose the PWM channels you want to control from the interface.
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust the frequency, duty cycle, and duration for each channel. Use the time-based controls to define how the light should behave over time.
3. **Preview**: Use the real-time preview to see how your settings affect the light intensity.
4. **Save/Load Presets**: Save your configuration for future use or load an existing preset to start with a predefined setup.
5. **Start/Stop**: Begin the PWM signal output to see your light experience come to life, and stop it whenever needed.
